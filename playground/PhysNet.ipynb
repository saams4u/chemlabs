    "large datasets, deep neural networks (DNNs) are a particularly promising ML algorithm for chemical\n",

    "forces and dipole moments of chemical systems. PhysNet achieves state-of-the-art performance\n",
    "on the QM9, MD17 and ISO17 benchmarks. Further, two new datasets are generated in order to\n",
    "probe the performance of ML models for describing chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and\n",
    "condensed phase systems. It is shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is\n",
    "crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a potential energy surface\n",

    "most eight heavy atoms) are able to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine\n",

    "Ala10 on the PhysNet-PES in gas phase, it is found that instead of a helical structure, Ala10 folds\n",
    "into a “wreath-shaped” configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46 kcal mol−1\n",
    "according to the reference ab initio calculations.\n",
